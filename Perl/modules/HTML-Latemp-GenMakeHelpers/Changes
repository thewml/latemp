Revision history for HTML-Latemp-GenMakeHelpers

0.1.8    Thu Aug 17 20:46:55 IDT 2006
    - Added a system test.
    - Factored out many methods and created several classes. Functionality
    remained the same.
0.1.7    Thu Jul 13 12:56:07 IDT 2006
    - Made the wml commands use -o instead of a > $@ redirection. This way,
    an empty file won't be created if wml failed, which in turn will cause
    it to be re-compiled upon the next invocation of make.
0.1.6
    - Added support for the TTMLS target to generate TTML-processed files.
    - Fixed a bug where a parenthesis was missing.
    - Added a COMMON_DOCS target to generate WMLs out of common/.
0.1.5    2005-12-07
    - Added a Makefile.PL wrapper to the Build.PL build process (taken
    verbatim from http://search.cpan.org/dist/accessors/)
0.1.3    2005-04-20
    - Fixed a bug in which the directory X8X_DEST was not mkdir'ed.
0.1.2    2005-04-19
    - First version
