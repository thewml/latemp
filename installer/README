Welcome to Latemp - a Web Meta Language (http://thewml.org/)-based
content management system for static HTML pages. (The name "Latemp" is a
play on "Template").

Refer to the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

After that type "latemp-setup" to set up an initial Latemp project, which
you can start with. Follow the instructions in the "latemp-setup --help"
or "latemp-setup --man" screens.
