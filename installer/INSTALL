These are the installation instructions.

First install the "Task::Latemp" meta-module from CPAN:

    # perl -MCPANPLUS -e "install Task::Latemp"

Or if you don't have CPANPLUS installed:

    # perl -MCPAN -e "install Task::Latemp"

Afterwards, install "scons" (http://www.scons.org/) and type 
"scons -Q install" to install.

By default it will be installed under "/usr/local". If you'd like to install
under a different prefix, specify it using the PREFIX parameter:

    scons -Q PREFIX="$HOME/apps/latemp" install

You'll also need to install Website Meta Language ( http://thewml.org/ ).
Check your distribution for packages, or install it from source.
