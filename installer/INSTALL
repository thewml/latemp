These are the installation instructions.

First install the "Task::Latemp" meta-module from CPAN:

    # perl -MCPANPLUS -e "install Task::Latemp"

Or if you don't have CPANPLUS installed:

    # perl -MCPAN -e "install Task::Latemp"

Afterwards, install "cmake" ( http://www.cmake.org/ ) and type:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

By default it will be installed under "/usr/local". If you'd like to install
under a different prefix, specify it using the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX parameter:

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/apps/latemp" ..

You'll also need to install Website Meta Language ( http://thewml.org/ ).
Check your distribution for packages, or install it from source.
