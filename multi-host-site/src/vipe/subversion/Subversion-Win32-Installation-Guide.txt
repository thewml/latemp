Subversion Installation Tutorial for Win32
==========================================

Requirements:
-------------

* For the client any Windows 32-bit system (Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003)

* For the server a Windows NT-based system (Windows NT/2000/XP/2003)

Installation Procedure:
-----------------------

1. Install Apache 2.0.x:

(skip this step if you only want to install the client)

Go to:

http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

and press the Win32 Binary (MSI Installer) link. After the download
is complete, install by double clicking.

Fill in the details, and select the port 8080 option.

2. Install Subversion:

Go to http://subversion.tigris.org/ ==> Downloads ==>
Packaged Distributions ==> Win32 ==> friendly Installer program ==>
svn-X.Y.Z-setup.exe

Install.

3. Check the subversion client:

    A. With your browser surf to http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/ and
    see that you see a list of files and directories there.

    B. Start a command prompt (Start -> Run -> "cmd")

    C. Change directory to a vacant directory.

    D. Type:

    svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/
    
    At the command line.

    E. After a short while you should see an entire directory tree being
    checked out.

    F. It's OK, to cancel this operation by pressing Ctrl+Break
    
4. Setting up a subversion.so service

    A. Copy the files "mod_dav_svn.so" and "mod_authz_svn.so" from
       C:\Program Files\Subversion\apache2\modules to
       C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\modules

    B. Edit the file C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\conf\httpd.conf
    using a text editor. Uncomment the line:

        #LoadModule dav_module modules/mod_dav.so

    and add a line:

        LoadModule dav_svn_module modules/mod_dav_svn.so

    to the end of the LoadModule block.

    C. In the command prompt, goto an empty directory 
    and type the command:

        svnadmin create myrepos

    D. Next, in httpd.conf add the following statements to the end of the 
    file:

        <Location /svn/myrepos>
            DAV svn
            SVNPath c:/path/to/directory/myrepos
        </Location>

    E. Start Apache.

    F. Surf to http://localhost:8080/ and make sure the server is running.

    G. Point your browser at http://localhost:8080/svn/myrepos/ and make
    sure you see a "Revision 0" notice at the top.


5. Congratulations!

    You can now run:
    
        svn checkout http://localhost:8080/svn/myrepos 

    from the command line and start populating your repository. Read the
    Subversion book for more information on Subversion usage.
