<p>
Welcome to the homepage of Latemp. Latemp (a play on "Template") is an
<b>offline content management system</b> (also known as a “static site
generator”) based on
<a href="http://thewml.org/">Website Meta
Language</a>, a powerful, off-line, framework for generating static HTML, and
server-side HTML that embeds code (such as
<a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>,
<a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">HTML::Mason</a>, ASP, or
<a href="http://perl.apache.org/embperl/">Embperl</a>). Latemp allows
one to create attractive, themable sites, which are usable, accessible
and fully standards compliant. Latemp is open-source software - fully usable,
modifiable and distributable under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT X11
license</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can find more information about Latemp in the
<a href="$(ROOT)/about/">about page</a>. You can also see
<a href="$(ROOT)/examples/">example sites that were prepared with
Latemp</a> and view their source code. The
<a href="$(ROOT)/docs/">documentation page</a> contains various documents
describing how to use Latemp.

Finally, you can actually <a href="$(ROOT)/download/">download Latemp</a>,
set it up and give it a try.

<h2>Should I use Latemp?</h2>

<p>
The title of this section is purposely risking
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines">Betteridge’s
Law of Headlines</a> and accordingly the short answer as of 2016 is “probably
not”. As I like to say, “every self-respecting programmer has written at
least one static site generator” since writing a basic one is easy and often
tends to be easier than learning an existing one. Many programmers who wrote
one decided to release it as “shrinkwrap” software (usually under an open
source licence) and <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">the Static
Site Generators list</a> currently lists over 400 of them.
</p>

<p>
Latemp started as a way to consolidate and extract some duplicate code and
logic I had in some of my Website Meta Language sites, which themselves evolved
out of directories of non-generated HTML pages that I maintained by hand
directly on the servers (without version control!). Since the time it was
released as open source software, it didn't really gain a lot of popularity
outside my own personal use, although it inspired some sub-projects such
as <a href="http://metacpan.org/">CPAN</a> modules, articles, or blog posts.
</p>

<p>
I'm continuing to use Latemp for some of my sites, due to being familiar
with it, because it works reliably for me, and because I cannot convert the
code that uses it to something else overnight (lacking the necessary
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-sharp-perl-chuck-norris-as-a-refactorer">Chuck
Norris nature</a>). However, if you are seeking a static site generator, you
are probably better off either writing your own using your favourite programming
language and template system, or using a more popular alternative than Latemp.
</p>

<p>
Some of the other options are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_%28software%29">Jekyll</a> - this
appears to be the poster child of static site generators, but after using it
for one site, I found it too opaque, with some poorly documented plugins
and extensions, and such a system where trivial things were easy, but anything
harder was very hard. I ended up converting the site away from it.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://ikiwiki.info/">Ikiwiki</a> takes the interesting approach
of storing the pages in repositories of any number of version control systems,
and allowing it to be used as both an online CMS and as a static site generator.
It seems to have a poor taxonomy though.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
For the <a href="https://github.com/Hamakor/linux.org.il">linux.org.il
sources</a>, I created yet another static site generator, this time using
<a href="http://template-toolkit.org/">the Template Toolkit</a> and some
Perl and GNU Make glue. I didn't use Latemp because I felt it needed too
many dependencies and was too hard to learn for such a site where I was
trying to encourage collaborators. So I wrote more than one static site
generator.
