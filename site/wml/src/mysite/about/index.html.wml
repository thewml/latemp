<h2>History and Motivation</h2>

<p>
After <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a> has learned HTML,
and has worked for a web-design company, he maintained his own web-site on
his University servers by manually editing HTML pages and other such content.
This, while being sufficient produced relatively uninteresting HTML with
little resemblence to an integrated site. As he had to maintain some other
sites he was looking for a better solution.
</p>

<p>
He came across <a href="http://thewml.org/">Website Meta Language</a> which
after he learned, and set up on his Linux servers, allowed him to build 
integrated, usable and attractive sites. As time went by he created a great
deal of sites this way, by copying the contents of an old site and adapting
it to the needs of the new site.
</p>

<p>
More recently, he came to the conclusion that he shouldn't duplicate his work
in so many places. As he came upon older sites, he often found he had to 
revise their build system or templates to adapt them to the knowledge he 
acquired more recently. To remedy this, he decided to create a content 
management system that will allow to maintain multiple sites by abstracting
the common code.
</p>

<p>
This was the birth of Latemp ("Latemp" being a play on the word "Template):
a powerful, integrated framework for maintaing static HTML web-sites. This site
, for example was created using Latemp, and so are 
<a href="$(ROOT)/examples/">others</a>.
