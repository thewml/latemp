This repository contains the source of Latemp - a static site generator
originally based on [Website Meta Language](https://github.com/thewml/website-meta-language),
but now also supporting other generators / template systems.

The name "Latemp" is a play on "Template", and was inspired by "LaTeX".

The main sources are under the installer sub-directory, and the Perl/
sub-dir contains some CPAN modules.

The Latemp home page is at:

- http://web-cpan.shlomifish.org/latemp/

- [Travis-CI builds](https://travis-ci.org/github/thewml/latemp)
- [AppVeyor-CI builds](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shlomif/latemp)
